The application GAMETIME has been developped by Michaël, Wendy, Pierre-Baptiste and Julien in 10 days.
It is the final project of the coding bootcamp La Capsule (https://www.lacapsule.academy/formation-developpeur-web/full-time).
The purpose of the project was to design and develop a mobile application using the tech stack we learned at La Capsule, and beyond.
